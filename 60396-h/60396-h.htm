<a id="spring"></a>
  SPRING MORNING<br />
</h3>

<p>
  Now the moisty wood discloses<br />
  Wrinkled leaves of prim√®roses,<br />
  While the birds, they flute and sing:<br />
  Build your nests, for here is Spring.<br />
</p>

<p>
  All about the open hills<br />
  Daisies shew their peasant frills,<br />
  Washed and white and newly spun<br />
  For a festival of sun.<br />
</p>

<p>
  Like a blossom from the sky,<br />
  Drops a yellow butterfly,<br />
  Dancing down the hedges grey<br />
  Snow-bestrewn till yesterday.<br />
</p>

<p>
  Squirrels skipping up the trees<br />
  Smell how Spring is in the breeze,<br />
  While the birds, they flute and sing:<br />
  Build your nests, for here is Spring.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="recollection"></a>
  A RECOLLECTION<br />
</h3>

<p>
  My father's friend came once to tea.<br />
  He laughed and talked. He spoke to me.<br />
  But in another week they said<br />
  That friendly pink-faced man was dead.<br />
</p>

<p>
  "How sad . ." they said, "the best of men . ."<br />
  So I said too, "How sad"; but then<br />
  Deep in my heart I thought with pride,<br />
  "I know a person who has died."<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="youth"></a>
  YOUTH AND AGE<br />
</h3>

<p class="illustration">
<img src="images/img-007.jpg" alt="To Man's End" />
</p>

<p>
  Say, is it dim and grim and all full of fear?<br />
  Not at all, not at all, my pretty dear.<br />
  Will there be no hope? Nothing to desire?<br />
  You shall be comforted sitting by the fire.<br />
  Will no one look at me? love me, if I please?<br />
  You shall doze happy with a little bread and cheese.<br />
  Even the springing grass&mdash;will it look pale?<br />
  You shall be gladdened with a little warm ale.<br />
  Shall I be trembling and querulous of tongue?<br />
  You shall be wiser than anybody young.<br />
  When the first thrushes sing, shall I not hear?<br />
  Not at all, not at all, my pretty dear.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="dream"></a>
  A CHILD'S DREAM<br />
</h3>

<p class="illustration">
<img src="images/img-008.jpg" alt="Boy and dog" />
</p>

<p>
  I had a little dog, and my dog was very small;<br />
  He licked me in the face, and he answered to my call;<br />
  Of all the treasures that were mine, I loved him most of all.<br />
</p>

<p>
  His nose was fresh as morning dew and blacker than the night;<br />
  I thought that it could even snuff the shadows and the light;<br />
  And his tail he held it bravely, like a banner in a fight.<br />
</p>

<p>
  His body covered thick with hair was very good to smell;<br />
  His little stomach underneath was pink as any shell;<br />
  And I loved him and honoured him, more than words can tell.<br />
</p>

<p>
  We ran out in the morning, both of us, to play,<br />
  Up and down across the fields for all the sunny day;<br />
  But he ran so swiftly&mdash;he ran right away.<br />
</p>

<p>
  I looked for him, I called for him, entreatingly. Alas,<br />
  The dandelions could not speak, though they had seen him pass,<br />
  And nowhere was his waving tail among the waving grass.<br />
</p>

<p>
  I called him in a thousand ways and yet he did not come;<br />
  The pathways and the hedges were horrible and dumb.<br />
  I prayed to God who never heard. My desperate soul grew numb.<br />
</p>

<p>
  The sun sank low. I ran; I prayed: "If God has not the power<br />
  To find him, let me die. I cannot bear another hour."<br />
  When suddenly I came upon a great yellow flower.<br />
</p>

<p>
  And all among its petals, such was Heaven's grace,<br />
  In that golden hour, in that golden place,<br />
  All among its petals, was his hairy face.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="fatlady"></a>
  TO A FAT LADY SEEN FROM THE TRAIN<br />
</h3>

<p>
  O why do you walk through the fields in gloves,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Missing so much and so much?<br />
  O fat white woman whom nobody loves,<br />
  Why do you walk through the fields in gloves,<br />
  When the grass is soft as the breast of doves<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And shivering sweet to the touch?<br />
  O why do you walk through the fields in gloves,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Missing so much and so much?<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="wasted"></a>
  A WASTED DAY<br />
</h3>

<p>
  I spoiled the day;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hotly, in haste,<br />
  All the calm hours<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I gashed and defaced.<br />
</p>

<p>
  Let me forget,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Let me embark<br />
  &mdash;Sleep for my boat&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And sail through the dark.<br />
</p>

<p>
  Till a new day<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Heaven shall send,<br />
  Whole as an apple,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Kind as a friend.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="france"></a>
  IN FRANCE<br />
</h3>

<p class="illustration">
<img src="images/img-012.jpg" alt="Poplars" />
</p>

<p>
  The poplars in the fields of France<br />
  Are golden ladies come to dance;<br />
  But yet to see them there is none<br />
  But I and the September sun.<br />
</p>

<p>
  The girl who in their shadow sits<br />
  Can only see the sock she knits;<br />
  Her dog is watching all the day<br />
  That not a cow shall go astray.<br />
</p>

<p>
  The leisurely contented cows<br />
  Can only see the earth they browse;<br />
  Their piebald bodies through the grass<br />
  With busy, munching noses pass.<br />
</p>

<p>
  Alone the sun and I behold<br />
  Processions crowned with shining gold&mdash;<br />
  The poplars in the fields of France,<br />
  Like glorious ladies come to dance.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="witch"></a>
  THE OLD WITCH IN THE COPSE<br />
</h3>

<p>
  I am a Witch, and a kind old Witch,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  There's many a one knows that&mdash;<br />
  Alone I live in my little dark house<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  With Pillycock, my cat.<br />
</p>

<p>
  A girl came running through the night,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  When all the winds blew free:&mdash;<br />
  "O mother, change a young man's heart<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  That will not look on me.<br />
</p>

<p>
  O mother, brew a magic mead<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  To stir his heart so cold."<br />
  "Just as you will, my dear," said I,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "And I thank you for your gold."<br />
</p>

<p>
  So here am I in the wattled copse<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Where all the twigs are brown,<br />
  To find what I need to brew my mead<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As the dark of night comes down.<br />
</p>

<p>
  Primroses in my old hands,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sweet to smell and young,<br />
  And violets blue that spring in the grass<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Wherever the larks have sung.<br />
</p>

<p>
  With celandines as heavenly crowns<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yellowy-gold and bright;<br />
  All of these, O all of these,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Shall bring her Love's delight.<br />
</p>

<p>
  But orchids growing snakey green<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Speckled dark with blood,<br />
  And fallen leaves that curled and shrank<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And rotted in the mud,<br />
</p>

<p>
  With blistering nettles burning harsh<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And blinding thorns above;<br />
  All of these, O all of these<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Shall bring the pains of Love.<br />
</p>

<p>
  Shall bring the pains of Love, my Puss,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  That cease not night or day,<br />
  The bitter rage, nought can assuage<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Till it bleeds the heart away.<br />
</p>

<p>
  Pillycock mine, my hands are full,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  My pot is on the fire.<br />
  Purr, my pet, this fool shall get<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Her fool's desire.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="dorset"></a>
  IN DORSET<br />
</h3>

<p class="illustration">
<img src="images/img-015.jpg" alt="Dorset scene" />
</p>

<p>
  From muddy road to muddy lane<br />
  I plodded through the falling rain;<br />
  For miles and miles was nothing there<br />
  But mist, and mud, and hedges bare.<br />
</p>

<p>
  At length approaching I espied<br />
  Two gipsy women side by side;<br />
  They turned their faces broad and bold<br />
  And brown and freshened by the cold,<br />
  And stared at me in gipsy wise<br />
  With shrewd, unfriendly, savage eyes.<br />
</p>

<p>
  No word they said, no more dared I;<br />
  And so we passed each other by&mdash;<br />
  The only living things that met<br />
  In all those miles of mist and wet.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="watch"></a>
  THE WATCH<br />
</h3>

<p>
  I wakened on my hot, hard bed;<br />
  Upon the pillow lay my head;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Beneath the pillow I could hear<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  My little watch was ticking clear.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I thought the throbbing of it went<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Like my continual discontent;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I thought it said in every tick:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I am so sick, so sick, so sick;<br />
  O death, come quick, come quick, come quick,<br />
  Come quick, come quick, come quick, come quick.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="people"></a>
  PEOPLE<br />
</h3>

<p>
  Like to islands in the seas,<br />
  Stand our personalities&mdash;<br />
  Islands where we always face<br />
  One another's watering place.<br />
  When we promenade our sands<br />
  We can hear each other's bands,<br />
  We can see on festal nights<br />
  Red and green and purple lights,<br />
  Gilt pavilions in a row,<br />
  Stucco houses built for show.<br />
</p>

<p>
  But our eyes can never reach<br />
  Further than the foolish beach,<br />
  Never can they hope to win<br />
  To the fastnesses within:<br />
  Rocks unsealed that watch the sky<br />
  And the tormented clouds go by;&mdash;<br />
  Darkest forests full of gleams<br />
  Ever-passing;&mdash;pouring streams;&mdash;<br />
  Chasms where a Monster lowers;&mdash;<br />
  Sweet and unimagined flowers.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="dawn"></a>
  DAWN<br />
</h3>

<p>
  So begins the day,<br />
  Solid, chill, and gray,<br />
  But my heart will wake<br />
  Happy for your sake;<br />
  No more tossed and wild,<br />
  Singing like a child,<br />
  Quiet as a flower<br />
  In this first gray hour.<br />
</p>

<p>
  So my heart will wake<br />
  Happy, for your sake.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="mountains"></a>
  MOUNTAINS<br />
</h3>

<p class="illustration">
<img src="images/img-019.jpg" alt="Mountains" />
</p>

<p>
  Mountains, mountains in the morning,<br />
  Great beasts backed with stainless snow,<br />
  Rocks which even the hawks have not visited,<br />
  Vast blue shadows climbing up their gullies,<br />
  Magnificence, magnificence of blue shadows.<br />
</p>

<p>
  Child unknown who shall be mine hereafter,<br />
  Your heart, too, shall leap at sight of the mountains,<br />
  The peaks and their shadows in the morning<br />
  &mdash;Uncaring for me or for any man&mdash;<br />
  Even as my heart has leapt, uncaring.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="peasant"></a>
  A PEASANT WOMAN<br />
</h3>

<p>
  I saw you sit waiting with your sewing on your knees,<br />
  Till a man should claim the comfort of your body<br />
  And your industry and presence for his own.<br />
</p>

<p>
  I saw you sit waiting with your sewing on your knees,<br />
  Till the child growing hidden in your body<br />
  Should become a living creature in the light.<br />
</p>

<p>
  I saw you sit waiting with your sewing on your knees,<br />
  Till your child who had ventured to the city<br />
  Should return to the shelter of his home.<br />
</p>

<p>
  I saw you sit waiting with your sewing on your knees<br />
  &mdash;Your unreturning son was in the city&mdash;<br />
  Till Death should come along the cobbled street.<br />
</p>

<p>
  I saw you sit waiting with your sewing on your knees.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="cambridge"></a>
  AUTUMN MORNING AT CAMBRIDGE<br />
</h3>

<p>
  I ran out in the morning, when the air was clean and new,<br />
  And all the grass was glittering, and grey with autumn dew,<br />
  I ran out to the apple tree and pulled an apple down,<br />
  And all the bells were ringing in the old grey town.<br />
</p>

<p>
  Down in the town, off the bridges and the grass<br />
  They are sweeping up the leaves to let the people pass,<br />
  Sweeping up the old leaves, golden-reds and browns,<br />
  While the men go to lecture with the wind in their gowns.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="autumn"></a>
  AUTUMN EVENING<br />
</h3>

<p>
  The shadows flickering, the daylight dying,<br />
  And I upon the old red sofa lying,<br />
  The great brown shadows leaping up the wall,<br />
  The sparrows twittering; and that is all.<br />
</p>

<p>
  I thought to send my soul to far-off lands,<br />
  Where fairies scamper on the windy sands,<br />
  Or where the autumn rain comes drumming down<br />
  On huddled roofs in an enchanted town.<br />
</p>

<p>
  But O my sleepy soul, it will not roam,<br />
  It is too happy and too warm at home:<br />
  With just the shadows leaping up the wall,<br />
  The sparrows twittering; and that is all.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="night"></a>
  AT NIGHT<br />
</h3>

<p class="illustration">
<img src="images/img-023.jpg" alt="Night" />
</p>

<p>
  On moony nights the dogs bark shrill<br />
  Down the valley and up the hill.<br />
</p>

<p>
  There's one is angry to behold<br />
  The moon so unafraid and cold,<br />
  Who makes the earth as bright as day,<br />
  But yet unhappy, dead, and gray.<br />
</p>

<p>
  Another in his strawy lair<br />
  Says: "Who's a-howling over there?<br />
  By heavens I will stop him soon<br />
  From interfering with the moon."<br />
</p>

<p>
  So back he barks, with throat upthrown:<br />
  "You leave our moon, our moon alone."<br />
  And other distant dogs respond<br />
  Beyond the fields, beyond, beyond.<br />
</p>
